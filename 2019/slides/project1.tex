\section{Mini-Project Requirement and Datasets}

This project as a warm-up aims to explore feature extractions using existing networks, such as pre-trained deep neural networks and scattering nets, in image classifications with traditional machine learning methods.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Pick up ONE (or more if you like) favourite dataset below to work. If you would like to work on a different problem outside the candidates we proposed, please email course instructor about your proposal.  
\item Team work: we encourage you to form small team, up to FOUR persons per group, to work on the same problem. Each team just submit ONE report, \emph{with a clear remark on each person's contribution}. The report can be in the format of either a \emph{technical report within 8 pages}, e.g. NIPS conference style (preferred format) 
\begin{center}
\url{https://nips.cc/Conferences/2019/PaperInformation/StyleFiles} 
\end{center}
Python (Jupyter) Notebooks with a detailed documentation, or a \emph{poster}, e.g. 
\begin{center}%\url{http://math.stanford.edu/~yuany/publications/poster_CleaveBioCPH2017_ForReview.pptx}
\url{https://github.com/yuany-pku/2017_math6380/blob/master/project1/DongLoXia_poster.pptx}
\end{center}
\item In the report, show your proposed scientific questions to explore and main results with a careful analysis supporting the results toward answering your problems. Remember: scientific analysis and reasoning are more important than merely the performance tables. Separate source codes may be submitted through email as a zip file, GitHub link, or as an appendix if it is not large.    
\item Submit your report by email or paper version no later than the deadline, to the following address (\href{mailto:deeplearning.math@gmail.com}{deeplearning.math@gmail.com}) with Title: \underline{Math 6380O: Project 1}. % (\href{mailto:datascience\_hw@126.com}{datascience\_hw@126.com}). 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Challenge}
The basic challenge is 
\begin{itemize}
\item Feature extraction by scattering net with known invariants; 
\item Feature extraction by pre-trained deep neural networks, e.g. VGG19, and resnet18, etc.;
\item Visualize these features using classical unsupervised learning methods, e.g. PCA/MDS, Manifold Learning, t-SNE, etc.; 
\item Image classifications using traditional supervised learning methods based on the features extracted, e.g. LDA, logistic regression, SVM, random forests, etc.;
\item *Train the last layer or fine-tune the deep neural networks in your choice; 
\item Compare the results you obtained and give your own analysis on explaining the phenomena.
\end{itemize}

Below are two candidate datasets. Challenge marked by * above is only optional. 

\subsection{MNIST dataset -- a Warmup}

Yann LeCun's website contains original MNIST dataset of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. 

\url{http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/}

There are various ways to download and parse MNIST files. For example, Python users may refer to the following website:

\url{https://github.com/datapythonista/mnist}

or MXNET tutorial on mnist

\url{https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/tutorials/python/mnist.html}

\subsection{Identification of Raphael's paintings from the forgeries}

The following data, provided by Prof. Yang WANG from HKUST,

\url{https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B-yDtwSjhaSCZ2FqN3AxQ3NJNTA&usp=sharing}

\noindent contains a 28 digital paintings of Raphael or forgeries. Note that there are both jpeg and tiff files, so be careful with the bit depth in digitization. The following file

\url{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tMaaSIrYwNFZZ2cEJdx1DfFscIfERd5Dp2U7K1ekjTI/edit}

\noindent contains the labels of such paintings, which are 
\begin{enumerate}
\item[1] Maybe Raphael - Disputed
\item[2] Raphael
\item[3] Raphael
\item[4] Raphael
\item[5] Raphael
\item[6] Raphael
\item[7] Maybe Raphael - Disputed
\item[8] Raphael
\item[9] Raphael
\item[10] Maybe Raphael - Disputed
\item[11] Not Raphael
\item[12] Not Raphael
\item[13] Not Raphael
\item[14] Not Raphael
\item[15] Not Raphael
\item[16] Not Raphael
\item[17] Not Raphael
\item[18] Not Raphael
\item[19] Not Raphael
\item[20] My Drawing (Raphael?)
\item[21] Raphael
\item[22] Raphael
\item[23] Maybe Raphael - Disputed
\item[24] Raphael
\item[25] Maybe Raphael - Disputed
\item[26] Maybe Raphael - Disputed
\item[27] Raphael
\item[28] Raphael
\end{enumerate}
There are some pictures whose names are ended with alphabet like A's, which are irrelevant for the project. 

The challenge of Raphael dataset is: can you exploit the known Raphael vs. Not Raphael data to predict the identity of those 6 disputed paintings (maybe Raphael)? Textures in these drawings may disclose the behaviour movements of artist in his work. One preliminary study in this project can be: \emph{take all the known Raphael and Non-Raphael drawings and use leave-one-out test to predict the identity of the left out image; you may break the images into many small patches and use the known identity as its class.}      

The following student poster report seems a good exploration

%\section{Heart PCI Operation Effect Prediction}
%
%The following data, provided by Dr. Jinwen Wang at Anzhen Hospital, 
%
%\url{http://math.stanford.edu/~yuany/course/data/heartData_20140401.xlsx}
%
%\noindent contains 2581 patients with 73 measurements (inputs) as well as a response variable indicating if after the heart operation there is a null-reflux state. This is a classification problem, with a challenge from the large amount of missing values. Sheet 3 and 4 in the file contains some explanation of the data and variables. 
%
%The problems are listed here:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item The inputs (covariates) are of three kinds, measurements upon check-in, measurements before PCI operation, and measurements in PCI operations. For doctors, it is desired to find a prediction model based on measurements before the operation (including check-in). Sheet 2 in the file contains only such measurements.
%\subitem The following two reports by LV, Yuan and LI, Xiao, respectively, might be interesting to you:
%
%\url{http://math.stanford.edu/~yuany/course/reference/MSThesis.LvYuan.pdf} 
%
%\url{http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04656} 
%
%\item It is also an interesting problem how to predict the effect based on all measurements, with lots of missing values. Sheet 1 contains the full measurements. There are some good work by previous students, which are listed here for your reference: 
%%\subitem The following two reports by LU, Yu and WANG, Qing, are probably inspiring to you.

%
%\end{enumerate} 

%\emph{In the final project, it is desired to take only those measurements upon check-in to predict the probability of non-reflux (non-reflow) after PCI operations. An interpretable model adds a big value! You may compare with your first warm-up project to show your improvements.}

%
%For example, the file {\tt PF00018\_2HDA.pdb} contains the 3D coordinates of alpha-carbons for a particular amino acid sequence in the family, YES\_HUMAN/97-144, read as
%
%{\tt{VALYDYEARTTEDLSFKKGERFQIINNTEGDWWEARSIATGKNGYIPS}}
%
%\noindent where the first line in the file is 
%
%97	V	0.967	18.470	4.342
%
%\noindent Here
%\begin{itemize}
%\item `97': start position 97 in the sequence
%\item `V': first character in the sequence
%\item $[x,y,z]$: 3D coordinates in unit $\AA$.
%\end{itemize}
%
%\noindent Figure \ref{yes_human} gives a 3D representation of its structure. 
%
%
%Given the 3D coordinates of the amino acids in the sequence, one can computer pairwise distance between amino acids, $[d_{ij}]^{l\times l}$ where $l$ is the sequence length. A \emph{contact map} is defined to be a graph $G_\theta=(V,E)$ consisting $l$ vertices for amino acids such that and edge $(i,j)\in E$ if $d_{ij} \leq \theta$, where the threshold is typically $\theta=5\AA$ or $8\AA$ here. 
%
%Can you recover the 3D structure of such proteins, up to an Euclidean transformation (rotation and translation), given noisy pairwise distances restricted on the contact map graph $G_\theta$, i.e. given noisy pairwise distances between vertex pairs whose true distances are no more than $\theta$? Design a noise model (e.g. Gaussian or uniformly bounded) for your experiments. 
%
%When $\theta=\infty$ without noise, classical MDS will work; but for a finite $\theta$ with noisy measurements, SDP approach can be useful. You may try the matlab package SNLSDP by Kim-Chuan Toh, Pratik Biswas, and Yinyu Ye, downladable at \url{http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/~mattohkc/SNLSDP.html}.

\section*{Peer Review}

In this exercise of open peer review, please write down your comments of the \emph{reports rather than of your own team} in the following format. Be considerate and careful with a precise description, avoiding offensive language. 

Deadline is \emph{11:59pm Oct. 19, 2019}. Your review assignment can be found at

{\centering{\url{https://deeplearning-math.github.io/2019/project1/project1review_assignment.pdf} }}

\noindent where each student (SID) is randomly assigned with 5 group reports (excluding your own reports). You should submit reviews at least for these assignments, but more reviews are welcome with additional bonus credit. 

You should put each review in a plain text separately with a title  comprising the corresponding group number (\textbf{not your own group}) and your name (e.g., \emph{\underline{rev1\_group03\_Ian\_Goodfellow.pdf}}). Submit all your reviews in a single zip file \textbf{using canvas}. Rebuttal is open afterwards.

\begin{itemize}
\item Summary of the report.
\item Describe the strengths of the report. 
\item Describe the weaknesses of the report.
\item Evaluation on Clarity and quality of writing (1-5): Is the report clearly written? Is there a good use of examples and figures? Is it well organized? Are there problems with style and grammar? Are there issues with typos, formatting, references, etc.? Please make suggestions to improve the clarity of the paper, and provide details of typos.
\item Evaluation on Technical Quality (1-5): Are the results technically sound? Are there obvious flaws in the reasoning? Are claims well-supported by theoretical analysis or experimental results? Are the experiments well thought out and convincing? Will it be possible for other researchers to replicate these results? Is the evaluation appropriate? Did the authors clearly assess both the strengths and weaknesses of their approach? Are relevant papers cited, discussed, and compared to the presented work?
\item Overall rating: (5- My vote as the best-report. 4- A good report. 3- An average one. 2- below average. 1- a poorly written one). 
\item Confidence on your assessment (1-3)
(3- I have carefully read the paper and checked the results, 2- I just browse the paper without checking the details, 1- My assessment can be wrong)
\end{itemize}

%Then please vote your top THREE favourite reports on Doodle:

\section*{Rebuttal}
The rebuttal period starts from now, till \emph{11:59pm Oct 27, 2019}. Restrict the number of characters of your rebuttal within {\bf{5,000}}. Submit your rebuttal in PLAIN TEXT or PDF format to \textbf{canvas} with filename comprising the corresponding group number: e.g. \underline{rebuttal1\_group02.pdf}. %(\href{mailto:datascience.hw@gmail.com}{datascience.hw@gmail.com}) with Title: \underline{CSIC 5011: Project 1 Rebuttal}.

The following tips of rebuttal might be helpful for you to follow:

1. The main aim of the rebuttal is to answer any specific questions that the reviewers might have raised, or to clarify any misunderstanding of the technical content of the paper.

2. Keep your rebuttal short, to-the-point, and specific. In our experience, such rebuttals have the maximum impact.

3. Always be polite and professional. Refrain from name calling or rude comments, especially in response to negative reviews.

4. Highlight the changes in your manuscripts had you made a simple revision.
